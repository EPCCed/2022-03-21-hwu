# Feedback

## Both sessions (day 1)

### The good
 - All instructors very helpful and approachable! Thanks :) Interesting!
 - Excellent arranging the training. Well structured with good examples.

### The bad
 - More reference to online lesson material. I didn't realise this was available! (and fell behind the course a couple of times). Introduce basic concepts for total begginers (like me!).

## Shell (day 1)

### The good

 - Very clear and step-by-step basic command very useful. Give the introductory knowledge to explore after dataset by ourselves.
 - Very cool seeing how backup.sh script is helpful in real life.
 - Covers commonly useful commands and ideas.
 - Nice and slow introduction. Easy to follow.
 - The explanations were very clear.
 - Course is ? at a good level.

### The bad
 - It might be more useful have the exercises dataset at the start of the lesson.
 - Too much time spent on ls (command) and then the rest went so much faster. Consistent speed would be nice.
 - More tasks to try learn first-hand how to combine commands.
 - Send the same files in advance so we can all use the same files. More time to practice and try on your own.
 - The concepts are very basic so far (I have been using most of these tools during the last year, so maybe I wasn't the target public).
 - For people following along, you hit Enter & run commands quite quickly. A lot of the time this makes it shoot offscreen meaning we can't see what was typed.

## Python (day 1)

### The good
 - Very detailed. Liked the visual examples.
 - Great course material (online resources) and teaching.
 - Very interesting and very useful stuff. Really liked inclusion of Python from Git Bash window.
 - Well explained. One feels supported if one gets lost in the middle of a class.
 - Good amount of experienced helpers who can help you anytime.
 - The explanation makes Python easy to digest for a beginner.
 - I liked looking at a real dataset & discussions on further uses. Very enthusiastic! Thanks for the workshop!

### The bad
 - A bit too fast.
 - Playing with prints and absolute fundamentals of Python could be a pre-requisite of course to enable us to go into more advanced Python sooner.
 - Wish we could have done more. Not instructors fault. Lesson simply doesn't have long on the schedule.
 - The level of detail was a bit low for someone who already has some knowledge in Python.
 - Start with a short introduction to the terminology, e.g., variable, argument, list, etc. and explain the structure of Python or basic rules.
 - A little bit lost with Jupyter notebook interface.
 - A glossary or something like that might be helpful. How commands got really confusing really quick. Not sure what is command or word/letters.

## Git (day 2)

### The good

 - Love the stickers and cheat sheets. Easy to follow instructions. Great practice and interactivity.
 - Good overview on how to use. Should come in handy in the future.
 - Really easy to follow :) Engaging + useful.
 - Friendly and helpful instructors. Welcoming environment. Great course material. I especially enjoyed the individual support & help received.
 - I liked exploring the options/questions from the crowd.
 - Quite straightforward and easy to follow.
 - Web resources on the ARCHER2 training site are very nice.
 - Well delivered with good examples that was very helpful. Thanks x

### The bad

 - Maybe start the session (officially) 30 min earlier to log in / setup and check everyone is ready to go.
 - I wish there had been a bit of talk as to why to use git and how to access old versions of files but good overall.
 - Group session/task on editing same dir would be useful (to see it in action).
 - Sometimes code dissapeared too quickly from the screen (would appreciate slower pace at places).
 - Maybe an exercise would've been nice.
 - Quite tucky to enter in the Github workflow. Maybe show before some visual graphic to help in the first step in.
 - Really enjoyed git part but if I had not already had Github account then I think content went quite fast. Maybe make a page on the training websites of things to do before coming to the workshop inc. Github account and the initialisation of git. That way everyone's on the same page.
 - Little difficult. Great team member.

## Python and SQL (day 2)

### The good
 - [Tony's session] Excellent introduction and explanation of the concepts and terms and so useful to know where to find more help and information (conda, numpy, pip, jupyter, etc.). Very clear and smooth overview of the basics.
 - [SQL session] Clear and pretty forward explanations. Nice to have some slides too.
 - [Overall] THANKS A LOT! Really good overview.
 - Great Python overview/intro session before lunch. Great intro to using Python! Instructors + helpers very approachable + helpful.
 - Very informative! Really enjoyed it. I really liked further uses of Jupyter labs, I'd hope to see a course page of it too.
 - [Python + SQL] Very clear. Well-motivated intro. Easy-to follow (SQL). THANK YOU!
 - Overall Software Carpentry course was organised well. I am happy to get learn topics covered in the course in depth.
 - Good variety of systems showed which all interact and work alongside each other.

### The bad
  - Experienced many issues with uni laptop (as personal wouldn't connect to WiFi) - would be useful to hold workshop in computer lab with appropriate software installed. Missed / fell behind due to these issues. More beginner friendly from start! 2nd day addressed this.
 - I would've like to see some plotting & plot polishing (add legends and etc).
 - [Python] A bit fast with the code at times.
 - Suggestion is to make it 3-5 days [...] and cover one full topic like Python or R or SQL.
 - Potentially needs an additional day / easier way to follow if you're behind. Scroll too fast.
 - Overall: Have the course longer (more days), and have move time to consolidate and practice.
